## Quick Guide

The Python Pulse is a casual monthly stream. It will serve as a conversation. I will review the materials you send to me and will be prepared with questions. You've been asked onto the stream because I am *__genuinely__* stoked to learn about your expertise with the audience! I'm here to jump in on fun conversation and serve as the voice of an interested and engaged audience.

With this podcast you will have an audience of the [VS Code YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs5Y5_7XK8HLDX0SLNwkd3w) and its ~320K subscribers and the [Visual Studio Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/visualstudio) and its ~24.5K followers. Your content will live sticky, accumulate views and give you feedback on your topic of choice! 

Once we've confirmed the stream date, I will send you a calendar hold for 30 mins before the stream, the hour (~ more like 45 mins) of the stream and 30 mins after in case we go over. 

I will update the calendar hold with the StreamYard link, stream link (for promotion) and thumbnail (for promotion). You can access stream yard from any browser, the stream title and description once we've confirmed. We can use the 30 minutes before the stream to show you StreamYard or feel free to schedule time with me to walk through. I'm happy to help.

I will receive a stream link that we can share around socials. Please promote the event in all channels you feel comfortable.

### Tips

- Close out of all other browsers and prorgrams
- Put your machine on silent, unless you're sharing with video
- Use incognito browser window
- If you're sharing slides, IDE or terminal, I recommend sharing screen because sometime StreamYard is a little wonky with sharing just a particular application


## FAQ

Q. Can I pre-record if I can't make the second Friday at 11am?

A. Yes! Let's talk about how to handle the live chat or where the audience can find you if they have questions.

---

Q. Does it have to be about Visual Studio Code?

A. No. It must be about Python specifically and we can discuss topics that would be interesting to our audience. It needs to be general enough to pique interest, but specific enough to encourage action.
